## What Needs Testing 🔍

1. **Full user journey:** Sign up with Google → create session → run council → see results
2. **Stripe checkout with real user:** ✅ VERIFIED on production. Authenticated token flow now passes for `/api/billing/checkout` (all tiers), `/api/billing/portal`, and `/api/billing/subscription`.
3. **Webhook delivery:** Stripe → councilnow.com webhook endpoint → subscription activated
4. **Credits purchase flow:** Buy credits → credits appear in account → use for session
5. **Zitadel without Google:** Email/password signup

## What I'm Doing Next

1. **Test the full auth → checkout flow** with a test user
2. **Verify webhook endpoint** is reachable from Stripe
3. **If anything breaks, fix it**
4. **Report to Matej: "Ready for first customer" or "Here's what's broken"**

## Blockers Found & FIXED ✅

- **FIXED 2026-04-19 13:50:** Starter and Pro were using the SAME Stripe price ID ($29 USD). Updated to correct EUR prices:

  - Credits 100/500/2000 price IDs also configured
- **Verified end-to-end:** Created real Stripe checkout session through full chain (internet → Traefik → LXD → hub → Stripe). Pro tier correctly shows €79.00 EUR.
